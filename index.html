        <p>The console screen is used to show the output of your code and tell you if something is wrong. :)</p>
        <script> console.log("Hello!");

console.log(first_name);

var last_name = "Singh";
console.log(last_name);

var full_name = (first_name).concat(last_name);
console.log(full_name);

var a = 5;
console.log(a);

var b = 10;
console.log(b);
